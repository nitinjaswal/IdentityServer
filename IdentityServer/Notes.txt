How it works

1. IdentityServer Configuration

Configures API Resources, API Scopes, Clients, and User Claims.

Issues ID Token and Access Token.

2. Web Client (OIDC Login)

Redirects user to IdentityServer Login Page.

Receives ID Token to authenticate the user.

Stores tokens securely in cookies.

3. API (JWT Authorization)

Accepts Access Tokens.

Verifies user permissions based on roles.


-ID token vs access token?
-ID token is generated when user logins. It is used for authentication purpose. ID token = Who is the user. It is used only for Authentication
-

When is ID token used?
- Only during login
- CANNOT be used to call API'S

What is an access token?
- Access token = Wat can the user do?
- It is used for Authorization

When is Access token Used?
- NOT used by Web Client
- Sent with every request to API


 How IdentityServer Issues These Tokens:
 - ID Token is issued when the user logs in (OpenID Connect flow).
 - Contains user claims like email, username, roles, etc.
 - Used by the web client to authenticate the user.

Access Token is issued to allow the client to call APIs on behalf of the user.

 - Contains scopes like api1, admin
 - Used by APIs to verify if the user is allowed to access certain endpoints.
